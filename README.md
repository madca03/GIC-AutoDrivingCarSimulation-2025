# Auto-Driving Car Simulation

### Introduction

#### 1. Environment
- All testing was conducted in a Windows environment.

#### 2. Folder Structure
1. AutoDrivingCarSimulation.Business
    - This is a class library containing the core classes used by both the Part 1 and Part 2 solutions.
2. AutoDrivingCarSimulation.SolutionPart1
    - This is a console application used for running the solution for Part 1.
3. AutoDrivingCarSimulation.SolutionPart2
    - This is a console application used for running the solution for Part 2.

### UML Diagram

Both solutions for parts 1 and 2 share the same set of classes (Field, Car, and CarInstructions). The Field class stores the boundary dimensions of the field, the Car class holds the carâ€™s current position and defines its basic movement methods, and the CarInstructions class manages a queue of instructions for one car.

### Part 1 Solution

#### 1. How to run and test the program?

1. Go to the folder **AutoDrivingCarSimulation.SolutionPart1**
2. Open powershell in the current folder.
3. Run the following command
    - ```Get-Content test.txt | dotnet run Program.cs```

#### 2. Algorithm

The  algorithm processes a series of car-driving instructions and applies them sequentially to a car object. Each instruction instructs the car to either move forward or turn (left or right). The simulation continues until all instructions have been executed.

### Part 2 Solution

#### 1. How to run and test the program?

1. Go to the folder **AutoDrivingCarSimulation.SolutionPart2**
2. Open powershell in the current folder.
3. Run the following command
    - ```Get-Content test.txt | dotnet run Program.cs```

#### 2. Algorithm

1. Initialize simulation state
    - A step counter (step) is set to 1.
    - A result object is created to hold the outcome.

2. Main loop: Continue while there are instructions
    - The simulation continues as long as at least one car still has instructions pending.

3. Calculate next positions for all cars
    - Create a dictionary to map each car to its intended next position before actually moving the cars.

    For each car:
    - Check instructions: If a car has no remaining instructions, it stays in place.
    - Otherwise, peek the next instruction (without consuming it yet) to see what the car intends to do.

    Derive intended position based on the instruction.

4. Detect collisions in intended positions
    - Check if more than one car is mapped to the same next position.
    - If a collision is detected:
        - Retrieve the list of collided cars.
        - Terminate the simulation immediately by returning result (list of collided cars, collision position, step count).

5. No collision: Finalize each car's move
    - If no collision was found, consume the next instruction for each car that still has instructions.
    - Execute the actual movement/turning.

6. Increment step and repeat
    - The simulation step is incremented.
    - The loop continues until no cars have instructions left or until a collision is detected.
